# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code Style

We use Google's code style convention and provide two accompanying tools in order to
lint code against Google's and also to re-format code based on Google's.

### Running Linter

Linter requires `cpplint` to run, so make sure you have `python` and `cpplint` installed.
cpplint can be installed by issueing following command:

```bash
pip install --user cpplint
```

If you have cpplint installed, you can issue linter by running following command:

```bash
make lint
```


## Setting up Visual Studio Code

In case you wish to use visual studio code, you have to first setup includedirs for intellisense
to work.

**First** make sure clang is installed. you can install clang via `apt-get install clang` under ubuntu systems.

**Second** determine location of `glib-2.0` and `gobject-2.0` include dirs via invoking `pkg-config`:

```bash
pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0
pkg-config --cflags gobject-2.0
```

**Third**, create a file `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` with following example content:

**remember to change `/home/user/` path to appropriate location**

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "mehdi",
            "includePath": [
                "/usr/include",
                "/usr/include/glib-2.0/glib",
                "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include",
                "/home/user/libcontext",
                "/home/user/libcontext/src"
            ],
            "intelliSenseMode": "clang-x64",
            "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/clang",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

## Debugging in Visual Studio Code

Executables forged by autotools toolchain use `libtool` to create a wrapper shell
script with links and runs the programms. This is fine until we want to use GDB debugger.
In that case we need to manually run linked program in `.libs` folder with custom
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` provided.

**First** Identify which test/tests you wish to debug. As an example, for `valuemap_test`
use `test/context/valuemap_test -l` to identify available tests, and
`test/context/valuemap_test -p <test_path>` to run a specific test.

**Second** Fill `.vscode/launch.json` with appropriate values to be used for debugger.
Listing below shows an example setup in which we try to debug a specific test using
provided `args` configuration.

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "valuemap_test",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/test/context/.libs/valuemap_test",
            "args": ["-p", "/valuemap/numeric_string_should_transform_to_int"],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "environment": [{
                "name": "LD_LIBRARY_PATH",
                "value": "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${workspaceRoot}/.libs"
            }],
            "externalConsole": true,
            "MIMode": "gdb",
            "setupCommands": [
                {
                    "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                    "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                    "ignoreFailures": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
